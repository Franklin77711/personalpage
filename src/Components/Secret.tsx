            <h3>Hi, I'm Robert...</h3>
            <p>As you may already know, I'm bit of a geek when it comes to fantasy, but I mean who doesn't love a little bit of magic in their life.</p>
            <p>I have been learning IT since elementary school, but never knew which direction to take. I've always had a connection to create visually appealing things with
                my own hands, and that's how I found front-end development.</p>
            <p>And, to say the least, it is one of the most magical journeys I'll ever go on.</p>
